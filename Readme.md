# Fault Localization using Deep Neural Networks

## Project Description

HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) is an unsupervised on-line machine learning system initially developed by Numenta. Although Multilayer Hierarchical Temporal Memory (M-HTM) were already proposed in Numentaâ€™s early papers, mostly single layer versions are used. In this project, a new approach to M-HTMs including Temporal Pooling is explored and evaluated.

The project is based on the Hierarchical Temporal Memory structure done by Numenta implemented from scratch. This project was done in a group of two and done as part of the "Advanced Machine Learning for Neurorobotics" course at the Technical University of Munich. The project report can be found in the "report" subdirectory. Some parts of the original report were excluded due to private information. Most neccessary information on how to run and use the implmentation are found in the report and in the "scripts" subdirectory.
